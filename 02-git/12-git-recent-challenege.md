## Question  
Explain a recent challenge you faced with Git and how you addressed it.

## Explanation about creating github action to validate the PR's

In a recent project, we faced repeated issues with inconsistent PR titles. This affected release automation and ticket tracking because the titles did not follow our expected format. To fix this, I created a GitHub Action that validates PR titles using a regex rule. The action runs on every PR event, checks the title, and blocks merges if the format doesn’t match our standard.

During implementation, I had to handle edge cases — for example tuning the regex so it wasn’t overly strict, ensuring the action also ran when titles were edited, and exempting automated PRs like dependabot.

Once implemented, it significantly improved the quality and consistency of our PRs, reduced manual review effort, and helped our release notes pipeline work flawlessly.


### 📝 Short Explanation  
This question is intended to assess your experience with Git at scale — especially around collaborative processes and governance. It’s an opportunity to demonstrate how you bring structure to complex codebases across teams.

## ✅ Answer  
A recent challenge I faced was implementing a consistent Git branching strategy across 100+ repositories used by multiple teams in my organization. Each team followed their own style — some had `main/dev`, others used `master/feature`, and a few used no long-lived branches at all. This inconsistency made CI/CD pipelines error-prone, releases chaotic, and collaboration difficult.

To solve this, we standardized on a lightweight **trunk-based branching strategy** with well-defined rules around `main`, `release/*`, and `feature/*` branches — and rolled it out in phases across teams.

### 📘 Detailed Explanation  
At a company-wide level, multiple teams were independently managing Git repos, and the lack of a unified branching approach caused several issues:
- CI pipelines were failing due to missing expected branches like `main` or `release`.
- Some teams rebased public branches, which broke collaborators' work.
- Merge conflicts were common in integration environments.
- Releases were often delayed due to confusion about which branch was production-ready.

Here’s how I addressed it:

#### ✅ Step 1: Analyze the current state
- Audited all repositories using automation (GitHub/GitLab APIs).
- Documented the branching models and naming conventions each team used.

#### ✅ Step 2: Design a unified strategy
- Proposed a **trunk-based development** model:
  - `main` → always production-ready
  - `release/x.y` → for stabilization and hotfixes
  - `feature/*` → short-lived, rebased before merge
- Outlined rules for using `merge`, `rebase`, and protection policies.

#### ✅ Step 3: Rollout with tooling & education
- Created templates (starter repos) with the correct branch structure.
- Set up default branch protections and PR requirements using GitHub Actions and branch policies.
- Ran onboarding sessions and created a lightweight Git handbook tailored to our strategy.

#### ✅ Step 4: Iterate with feedback
- Incorporated feedback from platform, dev, and QA teams.
- Adjusted the policy to allow for temporary exceptions during migration.

The result was:
- 95%+ repos aligned within 2 months.
- CI/CD pipeline reliability improved significantly.
- Teams were clearer on how and when to branch or merge.
- It became easier to onboard new developers and automate release workflows.
